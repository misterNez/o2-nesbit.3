For help: ./oss -h

To run: ./oss (default values set)

Options:
        -h		Display the help menu       

        -s [integer]    Set the number of slave processes (default: 5)

        -l [filename]   Set the name of the produced log file (default: nesbitP3.log)

        -t [integer]    Set the length of program timeout in seconds (default: 20)
     
     *Example: ./master -s 10 -l newfile.log -t 30

     
     *Press Ctrl-C during execution to clean up resources and terminate all processes.

 
Basic function:
     oss.c:
        -Master file. Continuously spawns child processes and waits to receive messages from them.
        -Spawns new child processes as old ones terminate.
        -Messages are stored in a message queue, which is also used to enforce mutual exclusion
        -Messages consist of a simulated clock, which is handled by a chunk of shared memory.

     user.c:
        -Slave file. Continuously enters a critical region of code and adds a random amount of time to clock.
        -Process is repeated until the total work is equal to a randomly generated duration period.
        -Cedes the critical region to other slave processes after a round if duration not reached.
        -Sends message to master process and terminates after critical loop.

     message.h:
        -Defines the data structure for the message queue.

     timer.h:
        -Defines the data structure for the shared memory timer.

     Makefile:
        make: Builds two executables: oss, user
        make clean: Removes object files, log files, and execuatable files.

Notes:

     Nice project. I learned a lot!
